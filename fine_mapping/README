# workflow in fine-mapping

1. calculate LD matrix
/project/nmancuso_8/elezhang/projects/jaxqtl/code/cis_mapping/run_jaxqtl_cis_est_ld.nb.sh

2. perform fine-mapping using susieR

after fine-mapping on eGenes:

/project/nmancuso_8/elezhang/projects/jaxqtl/result/finemap/code/run_susie.sh/run_susie_tqtl.sh

3. for each gene, run regression of pip on LD score of annotation
/project/nmancuso_8/elezhang/projects/jaxqtl/code/enrich/enrich_annot_sm.py

Next two steps are independent
4. use count_cs.R to count number of credible sets

5. use make_finemap_bed.R to gather snps with PIP > threshold
